These files find the solutions to anagrams based on the dictionary.txt file, which tells the program all valid words.
Run Anagram.java as follows: ‘Anagram.java inputfile outputfile datastructure’
where inputfile is one of the text files with unsolved anagrams, such as test1.txt, outputfile is the name of the file you want the solutions printed to, and data structure is either DLB or orig. If you enter ‘orig’, the program will use a sequential search, found in MyDictionary.java. If you enter ‘DLB’, the program will use a De La Briandais Trie.
